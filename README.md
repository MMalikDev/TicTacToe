# Tic Tac Toe Game

This repository contains a Python implementation of the popular Tic Tac Toe game, offering both graphical and command line user interfaces. Choose from three distinct opponents with varying difficulty levels for engaging matchups.
Additionally, harness Docker for seamless deployment across different environments.

## Features

- Two user interfaces: Graphical User Interface (Pygame) and Command Line Interface
- Three opponents: Human Player, Random Computer, and Minimax Computer
- Intriguing comparisons between AI players using local machines or Docker containers

### User Interfaces

#### Graphical User Interface (GUI)

The GUI leverages the Pygame library to create visually appealing graphics and animations.

#### Command Line Interface (CLI)

Designed for convenience and simplicity, enabling gameplay through the terminals.

### Opponents

Select from these three riveting adversaries:

- Human Player: Engage in exciting matches by competing against another human player on the same device.

- Random Computer: Test your skills against an unpredictable opponent. The computer randomly selects its moves without any strategic planning.

- MinMax Computer: Face off against a formidable foe employing the minimax algorithm, which calculates optimal strategies the during decision making processes.

### Performance Evaluation

Compare the performance of our machine models within Docker containers or native system deployments, facing them off in intense head-to-head showdowns.
