# Tic Tac Toe Game

This repository contains a Python implementation of the popular Tic Tac Toe game, offering both graphical and command line user interfaces. Choose from three distinct opponents with varying difficulty levels for engaging matchups.
Additionally, harness Docker for seamless deployment across different environments.

## Features

- **User Interfaces:** Offers a diverse selection of interfaces, including 1 Graphical User Interface (Pygame) and 2 Command Line Interfaces (Standard + Blessed).

- **Opponents Variety:** Choose from three opponents: Human Player, Random Computer, and Minimax Computer.

- **Comparative Analysis:** Engage in intriguing comparisons between the AI players utilizing either local machines or Docker containers.

### User Interfaces

#### Graphical User Interface (GUI)

The interface utilizes the Pygame library to deliver visually appealing graphics and smooth animations.

#### Standard Output Interface (SOI)

Designed for simplicity and accessibility, play using the built-in standard output of the command line.

#### Command Line Interface (CLI)

Leveraging the Python Blessed library, this interface offers a blend of functionality and aesthetics, providing an enjoyable user experience within terminal environments.

### Opponents

Select from these three riveting adversaries:

- Human Player: Engage in exciting matches by competing against another human player on the same device.

- Random Computer: Test your skills against an unpredictable opponent. The computer randomly selects its moves without any strategic planning.

- MinMax Computer: Face off against a formidable foe employing the minimax algorithm, which calculates optimal strategies the during decision making processes.

### Performance Evaluation

Compare the performance of our machine models within Docker containers or native system deployments, facing them off in intense head-to-head showdowns.
